```

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```bash

cd frontend
npm install
```

```bash
# Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:5000)
npm run dev

# Run backend only
npm run server
```

## Build & Deploy

There is a Heroku postbuild script, so if you push to Heroku, no need to build manually for deployment to Heroku

You can use the following commands to seed the database with some sample users and products as well as destroy all data

```bash
# Import data
npm run data:import

npm run data:destroy
```
